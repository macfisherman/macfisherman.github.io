      <description>A couple weekends ago one of my sons had a bunch of his friends over and before I knew it, I was told they were having trouble with the Internet. I checked Google, FaceBook and YouTube and didn&amp;rsquo;t have any problems connecting. Fast.com showed that bandwidth was at expected levels.
An hour later, I was having trouble connecting to some web sites being returned from Google searches. Then I realized that only websites that had IPv6 addresses where reachable.</description>

      <title>Perl and IPv6</title>

      <description>Since Perl 5.20, IPV6 support was improved to support a family neutral socket. This allows programs to be written for IPv4 and IPv6 in a fairly seamless way.

      <title>Thinking About Ipv6</title>

      <description>Ipv6 is the successor to IPv4. It essentially allows everyone to have a lot of IP addresses. I&amp;rsquo;m a Comcast subscriber. Comcast gives subscribers a /64. That means there are 2^64 (18,446,744,073,709,551,616) addresses available to assign hosts to.
Because there are so many available IPs in IPv6, most modern Operating Systems assign multiple IPv6 addresses to a single computer. Currently my computer has several different types of IPv6 addresses assigned to it.</description>
